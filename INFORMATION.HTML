            <p>Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting and storing rainwater from rooftops, land surfaces, or other catchment areas, typically for reuse. This eco-friendly method has been practiced for centuries and is now increasingly used worldwide. In today's world, with water scarcity becoming a major issue, rainwater harvesting offers a sustainable solution to conserve and use water efficiently.</p>
            <p>The main benefits of rainwater harvesting include reducing water bills, decreasing the strain on groundwater resources, and promoting environmental sustainability by preventing runoff and promoting groundwater recharge. Rainwater, when filtered and treated properly, can be used for a variety of purposes, including irrigation, non-potable uses like toilet flushing, and even for drinking water in some cases.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Techniques & Guides</h3>

            <h4>1. Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting</h4>
            <p>This method collects rainwater from the rooftops of buildings and channels it into storage tanks. The harvested water can be used for irrigation, washing, and even drinking if treated. It is one of the most common and effective methods of rainwater harvesting.</p>
            <p>Key steps include setting up gutters, downspouts, and storage tanks, and using a first flush system to ensure clean water collection.</p>

            <h4>2. Recharge Pits</h4>
            <p>Recharge pits allow rainwater to percolate into the ground, replenishing groundwater levels. They are typically used in areas where groundwater depletion is a concern. The water from recharge pits seeps into the soil, enriching the underground water table.</p>
            <p>This technique is especially beneficial in areas with limited surface water availability.</p>

            <h4>3. Rain Barrels</h4>
            <p>Rain barrels are a simple and affordable way to collect rainwater. These barrels are placed at downspouts to capture runoff from rooftops. The water can be used for irrigation, gardening, and washing outdoor spaces.</p>
            <p>Rain barrels are easy to install and maintain, making them a great option for homeowners looking to conserve water.</p>

            <h4>4. Surface Runoff Harvesting</h4>
            <p>This technique involves capturing runoff from paved or open spaces and directing it to storage tanks or recharge pits. It helps reduce the risk of flooding and ensures that valuable rainwater is not lost.</p>
            <p>Surface runoff harvesting is particularly useful in urban environments with large areas of impervious surfaces.</p>
